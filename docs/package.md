# Development package

The `0.1.x` archives are experimental development packages, not ABI-frozen 1.0
releases. Windows x64 and x86 archives are separate and must not be mixed.

## Run the packaged demo

From an extracted Windows archive:

```powershell
.\bin\lw-recognize-ppm.exe `
  .\models\rec.lwm `
  .\models\ppocr_keys.txt `
  .\models\sample-crop.ppm
```

Expected text:

```text
text=纯臻营养护发素
```

The demo intentionally supports only binary P6 PPM. This keeps it pure C and
dependency-free while demonstrating the complete public recognizer API. The
core library accepts decoded BGR8 pixels; production applications may use their
own JPEG/PNG decoder.

## Consume with CMake

Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the extracted package, then use either target:

```cmake
find_package(lw.PPOCR.C CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE lw.PPOCR.C::shared)
# or: lw.PPOCR.C::static
```

Consumers of `lw.PPOCR.C::shared` receive the required DLL import definition
through the imported target. Copy the DLL beside the application on Windows.

## Build a local archive

After configuring and building a Release tree:

```powershell
cpack --config .\build\CPackConfig.cmake -C Release -G ZIP
```

CPack writes the archive and its `.sha256` checksum under `build/packages`.
The package test installs to a clean staging directory and runs the installed
Demo against the installed model, dictionary, and fixture before packaging.
