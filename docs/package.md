# Development package

The `0.1.x` archives are experimental development packages, not ABI-frozen 1.0
releases. Windows x64 and x86 archives are separate and must not be mixed.

## Run the packaged demo

From an extracted Windows archive:

```powershell
.\bin\lw-recognize-ppm.exe `
  .\models\rec.lwm `
  .\models\ppocr_keys.txt `
  .\models\sample-crop.ppm
```

Expected text:

```text
text=纯臻营养护发素
```

The demo intentionally supports only binary P6 PPM. This keeps it pure C and
dependency-free while demonstrating the complete public recognizer API. The
core library accepts decoded BGR8 pixels; production applications may use their
own JPEG/PNG decoder.

Run the direction-classification demo against the same decoded crop:

```powershell
.\bin\lw-classify-ppm.exe `
  .\models\cls.lwm `
  .\models\sample-crop.ppm
```

It reports label `0`/`1`, orientation `0`/`180`, Softmax score, and resized
content width. It reports orientation but does not rotate the image.

`det.lwm` is installed so package validation covers the exact converted asset,
but this milestone intentionally ships no public detector demo or box API. It
is an internal probability-graph artifact until preprocessing and DB
postprocessing contracts are complete.

## Run the scalar benchmark

The packaged benchmark reuses one recognizer and emits machine-readable JSON:

```powershell
.\bin\lw-rec-benchmark.exe `
  .\models\rec.lwm `
  .\models\ppocr_keys.txt `
  .\models\sample-crop.ppm `
  3 20
```

The last two values select warm-up and measured iterations. Latency and RSS are
environment-dependent measurements, not release-wide performance guarantees.

## Consume with CMake

Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the extracted package, then use either target:

```cmake
find_package(lw.PPOCR.C CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE lw.PPOCR.C::shared)
# or: lw.PPOCR.C::static
```

Consumers of `lw.PPOCR.C::shared` receive the required DLL import definition
through the imported target. Copy the DLL beside the application on Windows.

## Build a local archive

After configuring and building a Release tree:

```powershell
cpack --config .\build\CPackConfig.cmake -C Release -G ZIP
```

CPack writes the archive and its `.sha256` checksum under `build/packages`.
The package test installs to a clean staging directory and runs the installed
Demo against the installed model, dictionary, and fixture before packaging.
